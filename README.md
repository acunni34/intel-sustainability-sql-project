# SQL Project: Sustainability Impact Analysis for Intel

## Overview
This project analyzes Intel’s device repurposing and recycling program using SQL queries.  
The goal was to evaluate how repurposing impacts **energy savings** and **CO₂ emissions reductions**, and to make **data-driven recommendations** for maximizing sustainability benefits.

## Skills Used
- SQL (JOINs, CTEs, Aggregations, CASE statements)
- Data analysis & insights
- Environmental sustainability metrics

## Key Insights
- Repurposing **older devices** yields significantly higher energy and CO₂ savings.
- Repurposing in **Asia and North America** has greater environmental impact due to higher carbon intensity in electricity generation.
- Laptops and desktops provide similar benefits when normalized by device count.

## Project Files
- [`Full Report (PDF)`](./SQL_Project_Sustainability_Impact_Analysis_for_Intel.pdf) – Includes SQL queries, results, and recommendations.  
- [`SQL Queries (intel_sustainability_analysis.sql)`](./intel_sustainability_analysis.sql) – Clean SQL scripts used in the analysis.

## Recommendation
Intel can maximize sustainability impact by prioritizing repurposing **older devices** in **Asia and North America**.
